    "title": "Multi-Dimensional Spectral Geometry of Biological Knowledge in Single-Cell Transformer Representations",
    "abstract": "Single-cell foundation models such as scGPT learn high-dimensional gene representations, but what biological knowledge these representations encode remains unclear. We systematically decode the geometric structure of scGPT internal representations through 63 iterations of automated hypothesis screening (183 hypotheses tested), revealing that the model organizes genes into a structured biological coordinate system rather than an opaque feature space.   The dominant spectral axis separates genes b",
