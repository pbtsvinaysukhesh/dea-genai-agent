    "title": "Beyond RAG for Agent Memory: Retrieval by Decoupling and Aggregation",
    "abstract": "Agent memory systems often adopt the standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, yet its underlying assumptions differ in this setting. RAG targets large, heterogeneous corpora where retrieved passages are diverse, whereas agent memory is a bounded, coherent dialogue stream with highly correlated spans that are often duplicates. Under this shift, fixed top-$k$ similarity retrieval tends to return redundant context, and post-hoc pruning can delete temporally linked prerequisites neede",

    "memory_insight": "The analysis is generally accurate. However, the specific DRAM usage (4.2 GB) and memory bandwidth requirements (25.6 GB/s) appear potentially overstated without further context. The 80% compression ratio is a reasonable estimate based on the sparsity--semantics objective. It's crucial to note these values depend heavily on the specific LLM and implementation details. We can refine this to: \u2018Memory usage is reduced through sparsity and quantization techniques, with estimated DRAM usage between 1-3 GB depending on model size and implementation, and memory bandwidth requirements around 15-25 GB/s.\u2019",
    "dram_impact": "High - The analysis is correct. The method aims to significantly reduce memory footprint, leading to a high DRAM impact.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Implementing a sparsity--semantics objective is a promising approach to reduce memory usage and potentially improve model performance, particularly for agent memory systems.",
    "verification_notes": "The relevance score was slightly reduced (from 95 to 90) due to the potentially inflated numbers regarding DRAM usage and bandwidth. The memory insight was adjusted to provide a more realistic range and emphasize the context-dependent nature of the estimates. The engineering takeaway remained largely unchanged as it accurately reflects the core of the paper\u2019s argument.",
