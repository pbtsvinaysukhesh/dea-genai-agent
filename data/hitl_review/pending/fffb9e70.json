    "title": "TrajGPT-R: Generating Urban Mobility Trajectory with Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer",
    "abstract": "Mobility trajectories are essential for understanding urban dynamics and enhancing urban planning, yet access to such data is frequently hindered by privacy concerns. This research introduces a transformative framework for generating large-scale urban mobility trajectories, employing a novel application of a transformer-based model pre-trained and fine-tuned through a two-phase process. Initially, trajectory generation is conceptualized as an offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem, with a s",
