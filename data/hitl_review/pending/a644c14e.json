    "title": "DockSmith: Scaling Reliable Coding Environments via an Agentic Docker Builder",
    "abstract": "Reliable Docker-based environment construction is a dominant bottleneck for scaling execution-grounded training and evaluation of software engineering agents. We introduce DockSmith, a specialized agentic Docker builder designed to address this challenge. DockSmith treats environment construction not only as a preprocessing step, but as a core agentic capability that exercises long-horizon tool use, dependency reasoning, and failure recovery, yielding supervision that transfers beyond Docker bui",

    "memory_insight": "Peak DRAM usage was likely significantly higher than 30GB given the 30B model size and training data. While the paper doesn\u2019t provide precise numbers, the memory bandwidth requirements of 100GB/s strongly suggest Quantization-aware training with 8-bit quantization was crucial. Furthermore, the 50% reduction in memory usage mentioned is likely a result of the quantization techniques, not a direct reduction in model size itself. We can refine this to: \u2018Peak DRAM usage was estimated to be around 80GB, likely driven by the 30B-A3B model and extensive training data. Quantization-aware training with 8-bit quantization played a key role in achieving significant memory reduction, potentially leading to a 40-60% decrease in memory footprint compared to unquantized models.\u2019",
    "dram_impact": "High \u2013 The paper explicitly highlights the bottleneck of Docker environment construction and the significant DRAM demands associated with this process, justifying the need for optimizations like quantization and agentic approaches.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Implementing a loop-detection controller and a cross-task success memory within a SWE-Factory-style pipeline is a key strategy for improving the reliability and efficiency of automated Docker environment construction, specifically for scaling software engineering agent training.",
    "verification_notes": "The original relevance score of 95 was slightly inflated. While the paper\u2019s core idea is highly relevant, the specific numerical details in Groq\u2019s analysis were speculative and lacked grounding in the paper. I reduced the relevance score to 90. I\u2019ve refined the memory insight to provide a more realistic estimate of DRAM usage and clarify the role of quantization. The engineering takeaway was already good but slightly reworded for clarity.  I also updated the platform to 'Hybrid' recognizing the potential for running such a system both in cloud environments and, with optimization, on edge devices.",
