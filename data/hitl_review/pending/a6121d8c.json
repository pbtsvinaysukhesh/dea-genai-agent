    "title": "CacheMind: From Miss Rates to Why -- Natural-Language, Trace-Grounded Reasoning for Cache Replacement",
    "abstract": "Cache replacement remains a challenging problem in CPU microarchitecture, often addressed using hand-crafted heuristics, limiting cache performance. Cache data analysis requires parsing millions of trace entries with manual filtering, making the process slow and non-interactive. To address this, we introduce CacheMind, a conversational tool that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable semantic reasoning over cache traces. Architects can now ask natura",

    "relevance_score": 90,
    "platform": "Both",
    "model_type": "LLM",
    "memory_insight": "CacheMind achieves 66.67% accuracy on 75 unseen trace-grounded questions and 84.80% accuracy on 25 unseen policy-specific reasoning tasks when using the SIEVE retriever. When utilizing the RANGER retriever, it achieves 89.33% and 64.80% accuracy on the same evaluations. The analysis does not specify peak DRAM usage or memory bandwidth requirements, and does not detail any compression or quantization methods employed.",
    "dram_impact": "High",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Bypassing a use case improved cache hit rate by 7.66% and speedup by 2.04%. A software fix use case resulted in a speedup of 76%, and a Mockingjay replacement policy use case achieved a speedup of 0.7%. These insights highlight the potential for targeted optimizations driven by CacheMind\u2019s reasoning capabilities.",
    "verification_notes": "Increased relevance score slightly to 90 due to the granular nature of the data presented.  Added specifics to the memory_insight section regarding the accuracy percentages, as the original analysis did not provide them. Improved the engineering_takeaway by including the specific speedup values derived from the use cases. No other changes were necessary.",
