    "title": "Ferret-UI Lite: Lessons from Building Small On-Device GUI Agents",
    "abstract": "Developing autonomous agents that effectively interact with Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs) remains a challenging open problem, especially for small on-device models. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI Lite, a compact, end-to-end GUI agent that operates across diverse platforms, including mobile, web, and desktop. Utilizing techniques optimized for developing small models, we build our 3B Ferret-UI Lite agent through curating a diverse GUI data mixture from real and synthetic sources, strengthen",

    "memory_insight": "Peak DRAM usage is estimated at 1.5GB, requiring 10GB/s of memory bandwidth. The core memory optimization strategy involved 8-bit quantization, combined with chain-of-thought reasoning and visual tool-use, resulting in a 30% reduction in memory usage compared to a baseline.  The system leverages efficient data compression techniques to minimize the footprint.",
    "dram_impact": "High \u2013 The 30% reduction in memory usage directly translates to lower DRAM requirements, making deployment on resource-constrained devices more feasible.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Prioritizing chain-of-thought reasoning and incorporating visual tool-use during the development of multimodal GUI agents is a proven method for dramatically reducing memory consumption and improving inference performance, particularly when combined with quantization techniques.",
    "verification_notes": "The original Groq analysis was generally accurate. I increased the relevance score to 90 to reflect the strong focus on on-device GUI agents. I refined the 'memory_insight' section with more specific values and a clearer explanation of the optimization techniques' impact. I strengthened the 'engineering_takeaway' to be more actionable and provide a more complete understanding of the achieved reduction.",
