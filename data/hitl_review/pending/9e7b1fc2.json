    "abstract": "Abstract:Representation learning has been essential for graph machine learning tasks such as link prediction, community detection, and network visualization. Despite recent advances in achieving high performance on these downstream tasks, little progress has been made toward self-explainable models. Understanding the patterns behind predictions is equally important, motivating recent interest in explainable machine learning. In this paper, we present GraphHull, an explainable generative model th",
