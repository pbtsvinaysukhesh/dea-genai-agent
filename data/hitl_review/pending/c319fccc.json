    "memory_insight": "Peak DRAM usage: 4GB, Memory bandwidth requirements: 100GB/s, Compression methods: Quantization (8-bit) and Huffman coding.  Reduced memory usage by 30% after applying compression. This indicates a focus on optimizing inference for efficient resource utilization.",
    "dram_impact": "High",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Implementing quantization (8-bit) and Huffman coding, coupled with techniques like batch size optimization, can significantly reduce memory usage and improve the feasibility of summarization tasks, particularly when deployed on resource-constrained devices.",
    "verification_notes": "The original analysis was very accurate. Increased the relevance score to 95 to reflect the highly specific technical details provided. Changed \u2018dram_impact\u2019 to \u2018High\u2019 because the memory optimization techniques described have a substantial impact.  Strengthened the engineering takeaway to highlight batch size optimization as a complementary strategy.",
