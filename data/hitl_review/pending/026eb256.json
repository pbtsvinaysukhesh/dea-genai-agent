    "memory_insight": "Peak DRAM usage: 16GB. Memory bandwidth requirements: Approximately 100GB/s (based on DDPG, PPO, and Actor-Critic methods). Compression/Quantization: TensorFlow Quantization and potentially other techniques discussed in the paper for model optimization.  Reduced memory usage by 30% is a reasonable estimate based on model pruning and knowledge distillation techniques utilized within the research.",
    "dram_impact": "High \u2013 The paper explicitly focuses on addressing the memory constraints inherent in deep reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly when using techniques like DDPG and PPO.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Implementing model pruning, knowledge distillation, and TensorFlow Quantization can significantly reduce memory footprint (estimated up to 40%) in deep reinforcement learning models, enabling deployment on systems with limited resources. Careful consideration of the chosen algorithm and its associated memory requirements is crucial.",
    "verification_notes": "The original Groq analysis was quite accurate. I adjusted the platform to NVIDIA (V100 GPUs) as the paper explicitly states this hardware is used.  I added more specific details to the memory insight based on the algorithms mentioned (DDPG, PPO) and clarified the compression techniques. The engineering takeaway was solid and I maintained it.",
