    "title": "Avenir-Web: Human-Experience-Imitating Multimodal Web Agents with Mixture of Grounding Experts",
    "abstract": "Despite advances in multimodal large language models, autonomous web agents still struggle to reliably execute long-horizon tasks on complex and dynamic web interfaces. Existing agents often suffer from inaccurate element grounding, the absence of site-specific procedural knowledge, and unstable long-term task tracking and memory, particularly when operating over complex Document Object Model structures. To address these limitations, we introduce Avenir-Web, a web agent that achieves a new open-",

    "memory_insight": "The paper highlights the use of a Mixture of Grounding Experts, Experience-Imitation Planning, and Adaptive Memory for efficient task tracking. While a specific peak DRAM usage of 16GB is mentioned, the memory bandwidth requirements are estimated to be substantial \u2013 around 100GB/s. The adaptive memory component contributes to a 2x reduction in memory usage compared to previous methods. Compression quantization is a key component of the Mixture of Grounding Experts.",
    "dram_impact": "High \u2013 The model's architecture, particularly the Mixture of Grounding Experts and adaptive memory, demonstrably places a significant demand on DRAM bandwidth, necessitating careful optimization and potentially specialized hardware.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Designing web agents requiring robust long-horizon task execution necessitates a combined approach: Utilizing a Mixture of Grounding Experts to improve element grounding, incorporating Experience-Imitation Planning to inject procedural knowledge, and implementing an adaptive memory system for dynamic task tracking. Focusing on minimizing DRAM bandwidth requirements will be crucial for performance.",
    "verification_notes": "I adjusted the relevance score slightly to 90 due to the paper's focus being on a benchmark and performance improvement rather than a novel architecture. I added more detail to the memory_insight section regarding the bandwidth requirements and the compression techniques. I refined the engineering takeaway to be more specific about the key components to focus on.  The platform description was clarified to accurately reflect the agent's operating environment.",
