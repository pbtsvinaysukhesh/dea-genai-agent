    "title": "Accelerating Local LLMs on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices via Distributed Prompt Caching",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Since local LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices imposes a severe performance bottleneck, this paper proposes distributed prompt caching to enhance inference performance by cooperatively sharing intermediate processing states across multiple low-end edge devices. To fully utilize prompt similarity, our distributed caching mechanism also supports partial matching. As this approach introduces communication overhead associated with state sharing over a wireless network, we in",
