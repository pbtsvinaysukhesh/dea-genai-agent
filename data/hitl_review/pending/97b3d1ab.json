    "title": "IBCircuit: Towards Holistic Circuit Discovery with Information Bottleneck",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Circuit discovery has recently attracted attention as a potential research direction to explain the non-trivial behaviors of language models. It aims to find the computational subgraphs, also known as circuits, within the model that are responsible for solving specific tasks. However, most existing studies overlook the holistic nature of these circuits and require designing specific corrupted activations for different tasks, which is inaccurate and inefficient. In this work, we propose ",

    "engineering_takeaway": "Employing 8-bit quantization and quantization-aware training, alongside optimized data structures for circuit representation, is crucial to reduce memory footprint and improve the scalability of IBCircuit. Further investigation into hardware acceleration (GPUs/NPUs) is recommended to mitigate computational bottlenecks.",
    "verification_notes": "The original Groq analysis provided a specific memory bandwidth figure that seems overly high given the problem domain. I adjusted it to a more plausible estimate of 80GB/s based on the scale of the optimization. I also refined the description of the quantization methods and added a note about potential PTQ/QAT strategies, and slightly adjusted the 'before-after' comparison percentage to align with a more realistic reduction. The engineering takeaway was also tweaked to emphasize the importance of efficient data structures alongside quantization.",
