    "title": "Dynamic Symmetric Point Tracking: Tackling Non-ideal Reference in Analog In-memory Training",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) performs computation directly within resistive crossbar arrays, offering an energy-efficient platform to scale large vision and language models. However, non-ideal analog device properties make the training on AIMC devices challenging. In particular, its update asymmetry can induce a systematic drift of weight updates towards a device-specific symmetric point (SP), which typically does not align with the optimum of the training objective. To mitigate th",
