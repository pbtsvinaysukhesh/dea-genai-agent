    "title": "Depth-Structured Music Recurrence: Budgeted Recurrent Attention for Full-Piece Symbolic Music Modeling",
    "abstract": "Long-context modeling is essential for symbolic music generation, since motif repetition and developmental variation can span thousands of musical events. However, practical composition and performance workflows frequently rely on resource-limited devices (e.g., electronic instruments and portable computers), making heavy memory and attention computation difficult to deploy. We introduce Depth-Structured Music Recurrence (DSMR), a recurrent long-context Transformer for full-piece symbolic music ",
