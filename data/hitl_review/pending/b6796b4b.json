    "verification_notes": "Groq\u2019s initial analysis is exceptionally low, likely due to misinterpreting the document's purpose.  A team update inherently has a high relevance score (10/10) because it concerns OpenAI's operational status. The memory-related insights are completely absent, as the document doesn't provide any technical data. Dram impact and deployment feasibility are also irrelevant \u2013 this is a communication, not a technical report.",
