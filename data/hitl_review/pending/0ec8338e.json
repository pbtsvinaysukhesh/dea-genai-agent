    "title": "Benchmarking GNN Models on Molecular Regression Tasks with CKA-Based Representation Analysis",
    "abstract": "Molecules are commonly represented as SMILES strings, which can be readily converted to fixed-size molecular fingerprints. These fingerprints serve as feature vectors to train ML/DL models for molecular property prediction tasks in the field of computational chemistry, drug discovery, biochemistry, and materials science. Recent research has demonstrated that SMILES can be used to construct molecular graphs where atoms are nodes ($V$) and bonds are edges ($E$). These graphs can subsequently be us",
