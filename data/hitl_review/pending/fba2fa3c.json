    "title": "Prior Knowledge-enhanced Spatio-temporal Epidemic Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting is critical for public health management, yet existing methods often struggle with insensitivity to weak epidemic signals, over-simplified spatial relations, and unstable parameter estimation. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal priOr-aware Epidemic Predictor (STOEP), a novel hybrid framework that integrates implicit spatio-temporal priors and explicit expert priors. STOEP consists of three key components: (1) Case-aware Adjac",

    "dram_impact": "High - significant memory footprint due to spatial dependency learning and parameter estimation.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Leveraging both implicit and explicit priors, coupled with spatial learning and adaptive thresholding, offers a robust approach to improving epidemic forecasting accuracy, especially when combined with efficient numerical computation.",
    "verification_notes": "The relevance score was lowered slightly as Groq\u2019s initial score of 95 felt overly enthusiastic. The memory bandwidth requirements were increased to a more realistic value given the complexity of the model. The DRAM reduction was adjusted to a more conservative estimate. The model type was refined to accurately reflect the hybrid nature of the approach.  The engineering takeaway was sharpened for clarity.",
