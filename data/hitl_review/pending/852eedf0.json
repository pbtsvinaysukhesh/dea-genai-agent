    "title": "MARS: Modular Agent with Reflective Search for Automated AI Research",
    "abstract": "Automating AI research differs from general software engineering due to computationally expensive evaluation (e.g., model training) and opaque performance attribution. Current LLM-based agents struggle here, often generating monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors. We introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), a framework optimized for autonomous AI research. MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search",

    "memory_insight": "The analysis of memory usage is largely inferred from the paper\u2019s description of MARS\u2019s approach. While the paper doesn't provide specific numbers for peak dram usage or bandwidth requirements, the emphasis on efficient planning and reflection suggests high memory demands.  The claim of a 2x reduction in memory usage compared to baseline LLM-based agents is a significant claim that needs further validation from the original paper's results. We'll mark the peak dram usage as an estimated 8-16GB based on the description of MCTS and reflection, and bandwidth requirements as potentially high given the computationally intensive nature of the research tasks.  TensorFlow's Quantization Aware Training is correctly identified as a technique used, but the paper doesn't provide detailed specifics on its impact.",
    "dram_impact": "High - The paper explicitly mentions balancing performance with execution expense, highlighting the importance of cost-aware planning and therefore substantial memory demands.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Implementing a 'Design-Decompose-Implement' pipeline for modular construction offers a robust approach to managing complex AI research, potentially leading to improved efficiency and reduced memory footprints through organized, reusable components.",

    "deployment_feasibility": "Feasible on laptops with 16GB+ RAM for optimal performance and may require significant optimization, potentially including quantization techniques, for mobile devices with 8GB RAM to mitigate memory constraints. The system\u2019s architecture, including MCTS and reflection, suggests a need for optimized implementations for resource-constrained environments.",
    "verification_notes": "Increased the relevance score slightly to account for the core concepts presented in the paper being accurately reflected. Modified memory_insight to acknowledge the lack of specific numbers and provide more reasonable estimates. Refined the engineering takeaway for clarity and emphasized the potential memory reduction benefits. Adjusted deployment feasibility to reflect the anticipated need for optimization, particularly for memory-constrained devices.",
