    "title": "Generative Bayesian Computation as a Scalable Alternative to Gaussian Process Surrogates",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Gaussian process (GP) surrogates are the default tool for emulating expensive computer experiments, but cubic cost, stationarity assumptions, and Gaussian predictive distributions limit their reach. We propose Generative Bayesian Computation (GBC) via Implicit Quantile Networks (IQNs) as a surrogate framework that targets all three limitations. GBC learns the full conditional quantile function from input--output pairs; at test time, a single forward pass per quantile level produces draw",
