    "title": "ECHO: Encoding Communities via High-order Operators",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Community detection in attributed networks faces a fundamental divide: topological algorithms ignore semantic features, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encounter devastating computational bottlenecks. Specifically, GNNs suffer from a Semantic Wall of feature over smoothing in dense or heterophilic networks, and a Systems Wall driven by the O(N^2) memory constraints of pairwise clustering. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), ",

    },
    "dram_impact": "Medium - The architecture's complexity and full batch training necessitate significant memory bandwidth and, consequently, a moderate impact on DRAM usage.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "The key engineering takeaway is the design and implementation of the Topology Aware Router to dynamically adjust inductive bias during graph traversal, addressing heterophilic poisoning and promoting semantic densification, significantly improving community detection accuracy.",
    "verification_notes": "I adjusted the relevance score slightly down to 90 as the paper emphasizes a novel approach within GNNs, not just a generic AI analysis. I refined the memory insight with more realistic estimates based on the described techniques (full batch, chunking, contrastive learning). I strengthened the engineering takeaway to more accurately reflect the core contribution of the Topology Aware Router. The dram impact was adjusted to reflect the demands of the architecture.  The peak dram usage was estimated \u2013 a specific number wasn't provided in the original paper, but is a reasonable range given the described architecture.",
