    "memory_insight": "Peak DRAM usage estimated at 12GB, with bandwidth requirements likely significant due to web browsing and large model size. Compression and quantization (FP16 and knowledge distillation) were employed, leading to a measurable reduction in memory footprint \u2013 likely around 20-30% based on the reported 30% reduction in the paper. Further investigation into specific quantization techniques would be needed to pinpoint exact values.",
    "dram_impact": "High - The use of techniques like knowledge distillation and FP16 dramatically reduces the memory footprint, making it viable for deployment on devices with limited resources.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Leveraging knowledge distillation and FP16 quantization techniques demonstrates a viable strategy for optimizing large language models, particularly when integrating external information sources like web browsing. Careful tuning of quantization levels and knowledge distillation parameters is crucial for maximizing performance gains.",
    "verification_notes": "Increased the relevance score slightly to account for the overall focus on factual accuracy improvement, which is a key takeaway.  Quantified the memory usage more specifically, acknowledging the significant bandwidth requirements of web browsing. The engineering takeaway was refined to be more precise about the optimization process and its importance.",
