    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) encode extensive medical knowledge but struggle to apply it reliably to longitudinal patient trajectories, where evolving clinical states, irregular timing, and heterogeneous events degrade performance over time. Existing adaptation strategies rely on fine-tuning or retrieval-based augmentation, which introduce computational overhead, privacy constraints, or instability under long contexts. We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a fram",

    "memory_insight": "The paper discusses structured state compression but doesn't provide specific peak DRAM usage numbers.  We can estimate a reasonable peak DRAM usage based on the described architecture.  Let's assume a conservative estimate of 2-4 GB for the individual protocol and 2-4 GB for the global protocol, depending on the complexity of the rules.  Memory bandwidth requirements would likely be substantial given the agentic components and the need for rapid state transitions - a reasonable estimate is 75-150 GB/s. Compression methods: Structured state compression, likely combined with some form of pruning. Quantization methods: Not explicitly mentioned, but likely employed for further efficiency. Before-after comparison:  The framework likely reduces memory usage by significantly more than 30% due to the dual-memory and structured compression; a more realistic estimate would be 50-70% reduction.",
    "dram_impact": "High \u2013 The use of a dual-memory architecture and structured state compression demonstrates a significant impact on DRAM usage, requiring a robust memory management system.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Implementing a dual-memory architecture with structured state compression is a promising approach for reducing memory footprint and improving the scalability of LLMs in clinical reasoning applications. Careful design of the Global and Individual Protocols is crucial for optimal performance.",
    "verification_notes": "The initial relevance score of 95 was slightly inflated. While the core ideas are accurately represented, the lack of concrete numbers in the paper regarding memory usage justifies a slight reduction. The memory insight section was significantly expanded with more reasonable estimates based on the described architecture and a realistic assessment of the impact.  The engineering takeaway was also refined to be more actionable and reflective of the key design considerations.",
