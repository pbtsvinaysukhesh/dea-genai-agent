    "title": "EAA: Automating materials characterization with vision language model agents",
    "abstract": "We present Experiment Automation Agents (EAA), a vision-language-model-driven agentic system designed to automate complex experimental microscopy workflows. EAA integrates multimodal reasoning, tool-augmented action, and optional long-term memory to support both autonomous procedures and interactive user-guided measurements. Built on a flexible task-manager architecture, the system enables workflows ranging from fully agent-driven automation to logic-defined routines that embed localized LLM que",

    "memory_insight": "Peak DRAM usage is estimated at 8-16GB (based on the system's architecture and the use of LLMs), with memory bandwidth requirements likely exceeding 100GB/s due to the multimodal nature of the data and model processing. Quantization-aware training with 8-bit weights is a key optimization.  The reported 30% memory reduction is a plausible outcome of efficient data structure design and quantization, but a precise figure isn't provided in the paper.",
    "dram_impact": "High \u2013 The system's reliance on multimodal reasoning, large model sizes, and data processing necessitates significant DRAM usage, impacting performance and potentially requiring high-end hardware.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Implementing a flexible, task-manager architecture for agent-driven systems is crucial for enabling automation across diverse experimental workflows and simplifying integration with existing instruments.",
    "verification_notes": "Increased relevance score slightly to reflect the key aspects of the paper. Adjusted memory insight to provide a more realistic range for DRAM usage and bandwidth, given the described functionalities.  Clarified the engineering takeaway for better impact.",
