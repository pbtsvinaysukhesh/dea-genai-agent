    "title": "Hierarchical Molecular Representation Learning via Fragment-Based Self-Supervised Embedding Prediction",
    "abstract": "Graph self-supervised learning (GSSL) has demonstrated strong potential for generating expressive graph embeddings without the need for human annotations, making it particularly valuable in domains with high labeling costs such as molecular graph analysis. However, existing GSSL methods mostly focus on node- or edge-level information, often ignoring chemically relevant substructures which strongly influence molecular properties. In this work, we propose Graph Semantic Predictive Network (GraSPNe",
