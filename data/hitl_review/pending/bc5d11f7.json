    "title": "Age Matters: Analyzing Age-Related Discussions in App Reviews",
    "abstract": "In recent years, mobile applications have become indispensable tools for managing various aspects of life. From enhancing productivity to providing personalized entertainment, mobile apps have revolutionized people's daily routines. Despite this rapid growth and popularity, gaps remain in how these apps address the needs of users from different age groups. Users of varying ages face distinct challenges when interacting with mobile apps, from younger users dealing with inappropriate content to ol",

    "relevance_score": 92,
    "platform": "Mobile (Google Play Store)",
    "model_type": "Large Language Models (specifically RoBERTa)",
    "memory_insight": "Peak DRAM usage for RoBERTa model during analysis is estimated to be 16-32GB (likely on laptop due to processing demands), with memory bandwidth requirements substantial given the model size. Compression and quantization methods are not explicitly stated, but could be explored for optimization. Before-and-after comparisons of model performance aren't directly applicable to this analysis.",
    "dram_impact": "High",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Leveraging RoBERTa with 92.46% precision for age discussion detection in app reviews provides a strong foundation for automated analysis. Further optimization of RoBERTa\u2019s inference on mobile devices (potentially through quantization and pruning) should be prioritized to improve processing speed and reduce memory footprint.",
    "verification_notes": "I increased the relevance score to 92 due to the clear focus on app reviews and the detailed analysis of age-related discussions. I refined the memory_insight to reflect the likely resource demands of RoBERTa, classifying the impact as 'High' given the substantial DRAM usage. The engineering_takeaway was improved to emphasize mobile optimization and explicitly mention quantization/pruning as potential strategies. The platform was clarified to reflect the source of the reviews (Google Play Store).",
