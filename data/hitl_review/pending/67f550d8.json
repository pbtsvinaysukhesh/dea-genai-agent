    "abstract": "Decentralized federated learning (DFL) based on low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables mobile devices with multi-task datasets to collaboratively fine-tune a large language model (LLM) by exchanging locally updated parameters with a subset of neighboring devices via wireless connections for knowledge integration.However, directly aggregating parameters fine-tuned on heterogeneous datasets induces three primary issues across the DFL life-cycle: (i) \\textit{catastrophic knowledge forgetting during fin",
