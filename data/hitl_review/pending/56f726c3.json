    "title": "Compact Circulant Layers with Spectral Priors",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Critical applications in areas such as medicine, robotics and autonomous systems require compact (i.e., memory efficient), uncertainty-aware neural networks suitable for edge and other resource-constrained deployments. We study compact spectral circulant and block-circulant-with-circulant-blocks (BCCB) layers: FFT-diagonalizable circular convolutions whose weights live directly in the real FFT (RFFT) half (1D) or half-plane (2D). Parameterizing filters in the frequency domain lets us im",

Adjusted the platform to 'Edge/Mobile' as the focus is on resource-constrained deployments. Refined the 'before_after_comparison' to give a more realistic estimate. Clarified that the variational inference is heavily reliant on spectral priors.",
