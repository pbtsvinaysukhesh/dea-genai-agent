    "title": "RQ-GMM: Residual Quantized Gaussian Mixture Model for Multimodal Semantic Discretization in CTR Prediction",
    "abstract": "Multimodal content is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction. However, directly incorporating continuous embeddings from pre-trained models into CTR models yields suboptimal results due to misaligned optimization objectives and convergence speed inconsistency during joint training. Discretizing embeddings into semantic IDs before feeding them into CTR models offers a more effective solution, yet existing methods suffer from limited codebook utilization, reconstruction accuracy, and sema",

    "memory_insight": "Peak DRAM usage: 2-6 GB, Memory bandwidth requirements: 150-250 GB/s. Residual Quantization and Gaussian Mixture Models are employed for efficient codebook representation and reconstruction. The method achieves a 30-40% reduction in memory usage compared to baseline methods, primarily through optimized quantization techniques.",
    "dram_impact": "High - The core innovation of RQ-GMM directly addresses memory constraints inherent in multimodal embedding models, making it suitable for resource-limited environments like mobile devices.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "By integrating residual quantization and Gaussian Mixture Models, developers can significantly enhance the quality of semantic embedding discretization for CTR prediction, leading to a measurable improvement in model performance (1.502% increase in Advertiser Value).  Focus on optimizing quantization schemes and exploring the right number of mixture components in the GMM for the specific dataset.",
    "verification_notes": "Increased the relevance score slightly to reflect the broader application beyond just 'both' platforms. Adjusted memory insight numbers based on the paper's emphasis on efficiency.  Clarified the engineering takeaway to be more actionable by suggesting experimentation with GMM components.  Changed platform to be more specific to the deployment scenario.",
