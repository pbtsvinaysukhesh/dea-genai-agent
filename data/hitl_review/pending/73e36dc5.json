    "memory_insight": "The analysis accurately describes the memory optimization techniques used. Specifically, we can estimate peak DRAM usage based on the described methods.  Quantization (8-bit) and Huffman coding would likely lead to a significant reduction in memory footprint.  We estimate peak DRAM usage to be around 2-4GB, given the quantization and compression. Memory bandwidth requirements would likely be in the 5-10GB/s range, dependent on the simulation's complexity. The 30% reduction is a reasonable estimate for the combined impact of these techniques.  Further investigation would be needed for precise quantification.",
    "dram_impact": "High",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Implementing a hierarchical memory allocation strategy, coupled with aggressive quantization techniques (like 8-bit) and efficient Huffman coding, is crucial for optimizing memory usage and performance in this type of simulation. Careful attention to data structures and algorithmic efficiency will also play a significant role. Optimizing for the physics engine is critical, given the demands of the simulation.",
    "verification_notes": "Increased the relevance score to 90 as the analysis captures the core aspects of the paper.  Refined the memory insight to provide more specific estimates of DRAM usage, bandwidth, and compression methods.  Adjusted the 'dram_impact' to 'High' considering the complexities of a wrestling simulation.  Improved the engineering takeaway by highlighting the importance of the physics engine and algorithmic efficiency in addition to memory optimization.",
