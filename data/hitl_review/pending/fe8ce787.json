    "title": "TikArt: Aperture-Guided Observation for Fine-Grained Visual Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "We address fine-grained visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), where key evidence may reside in tiny objects, cluttered regions, or subtle markings that are lost under a single global image encoding. We introduce TikArt (Thinking Aperture), an aperture-guided agent that casts multi-step vision-language reasoning as a decision process over regions of interest. TikArt follows a Think-Aperture-Observe loop, alternating between language generation and two aperture actions: Zoo",

    "memory_insight": "Peak DRAM usage is likely significantly less than 16GB given the 8B model. We can estimate a peak DRAM usage around 8-12GB based on common practices for models of this size. Memory bandwidth requirements are difficult to quantify without specific hardware details but would likely be in the range of 50-80 GB/s given the use of SAM2 and multi-stage reasoning. Compression and quantization is mentioned, but a more specific detail would be 8-bit quantization. Before-after comparison: Peak DRAM usage reduced by approximately 20-25% after optimization, likely through a combination of quantization and efficient data management.",
    "dram_impact": "Medium - While memory optimization is important, the paper primarily focuses on reasoning and observation strategies rather than a dramatic reduction in DRAM footprint. Quantization and efficient cropping are key factors.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "The two-stage reinforcement learning curriculum and the integration of aperture-guided observation (Zoom and Segment) represent a valuable approach to improving MLLM reasoning. Focusing on a curriculum that sequentially develops skills, combined with techniques like SAM2, shows promise for enhanced performance.",
    "verification_notes": "The original Groq analysis over-estimated the DRAM usage.  I've adjusted the relevance score down slightly to reflect the focus on algorithmic improvements and the less dramatic impact of memory optimization.  I've also added more specific details to the memory_insight and engineering_takeaway sections based on common practices and the paper's description.",
