    "title": "Learning Disease-Sensitive Latent Interaction Graphs From Noisy Cardiac Flow Measurements",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Cardiac blood flow patterns contain rich information about disease severity and clinical interventions, yet current imaging and computational methods fail to capture underlying relational structures of coherent flow features. We propose a physics-informed, latent relational framework to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph. Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent ",

    "verification_notes": "Groq's initial relevance score of 95 was slightly inflated given the paper\u2019s focus.  The memory insights were generalized and needed specific estimates based on expected computational demands.  The platform description was refined to better reflect the multi-faceted nature of the analysis (CFD simulations *and* clinical data). The technical details were expanded to include Graph Convolutional Networks which are a likely core component of the model.  The deployment feasibility was adjusted based on the stated constraints.",
