    "title": "veScale-FSDP: Flexible and High-Performance FSDP at Scale",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), also known as ZeRO, is widely used for training large-scale models, featuring its flexibility and minimal intrusion on model code. However, current FSDP systems struggle with structure-aware training methods (e.g., block-wise quantized training) and with non-element-wise optimizers (e.g., Shampoo and Muon) used in cutting-edge models (e.g., Gemini, Kimi K2). FSDP's fixed element- or row-wise sharding formats conflict with the block-structured computat",

    "engineering_takeaway": "The successful implementation of RaggedShard and a structure-aware planning algorithm provides a pathway for achieving both flexibility and performance improvements in FSDP systems at scale, particularly when supporting advanced training techniques like block-wise quantization.",
    "verification_notes": "The original Groq analysis was largely accurate. I slightly adjusted the memory_insight descriptions for greater specificity and clarity, particularly around the benefits of efficient data placement. The engineering takeaway was already well-defined, so no changes were made there. The relevance score was adjusted slightly down from 95 as the original score felt a bit inflated.  The phrasing was tweaked for improved readability and to better reflect the paper's emphasis.",
