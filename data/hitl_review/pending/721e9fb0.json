    "title": "Stochastic Neural Networks for Quantum Devices",
    "abstract": "This work presents a formulation to express and optimize stochastic neural networks as quantum circuits in gate-based quantum computing. Motivated by a classical perceptron, stochastic neurons are introduced and combined into a quantum neural network. The Kiefer-Wolfowitz algorithm in combination with simulated annealing is used for training the network weights. Several topologies and models are presented, including shallow fully connected networks, Hopfield Networks, Restricted Boltzmann Machin",
