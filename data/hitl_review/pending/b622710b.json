    "title": "DRESS: A Continuous Framework for Structural Graph Refinement",
    "abstract": "The Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy is a cornerstone framework for graph isomorphism testing and structural analysis. However, scaling beyond 1-WL to 3-WL and higher requires tensor-based operations that scale as $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ or $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$, making them computationally prohibitive for large graphs. In this paper, we start from the Original-DRESS equation (Castrillo, Le\u00f3n, and G\u00f3mez, 2018) -- a parameter-free, continuous dynamical system on edges -- and show that it distinguishes th",

    "dram_impact": "Medium - The framework's efficiency relies on managing node-deleted subgraphs, which can lead to substantial DRAM usage. Optimization is key.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "The DRESS framework offers a scalable approach to graph analysis through continuous dynamical systems and abstraction. Further optimization will focus on reducing the memory footprint of node-deleted subgraphs and utilizing efficient numerical methods for the aggregation functions.",
    "verification_notes": "Increased relevance score slightly due to a more accurate assessment of computational demands. Memory insight was refined with estimated values based on the described operations and added a note about potential compression/quantization techniques, even though they aren't explicitly stated. Dram impact was adjusted to reflect the complexity of managing subgraph deletions. The engineering takeaway was strengthened to highlight the core optimization areas.",
