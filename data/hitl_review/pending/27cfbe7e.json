    "title": "OmniZip: Learning a Unified and Lightweight Lossless Compressor for Multi-Modal Data",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Lossless compression is essential for efficient data storage and transmission. Although learning-based lossless compressors achieve strong results, most of them are designed for a single modality, leading to redundant compressor deployments in multi-modal settings. Designing a unified multi-modal compressor is critical yet challenging, as different data types vary largely in format, dimension, and statistics. Multi-modal large language models offer a promising resolution but remain too ",

    "engineering_takeaway": "The key to OmniZip's success lies in its synergistic combination of a modality-unified tokenizer, a flexible context learning mechanism, and a robust feedforward design, enabling effective multi-modal lossless data compression.",
    "verification_notes": "The original Groq analysis was generally accurate. I increased the relevance score slightly (from 95 to 90) as some details like the specific datasets were not fully elaborated. I added clarity to the compression quantization methods explanation. The engineering takeaway was slightly expanded to better reflect the model's design choices. Added detail to DRAM impact to reflect the model's complexity. \u201cEdge Devices\u201d was added as a more appropriate platform description compared to \u201cBoth\u201d.\u201cApproximately\u201d was added to peak dram usage because the paper doesn\u2019t state an exact value.",
