    "memory_insight": "The analysis correctly identifies key memory optimization techniques. However, the specific DRAM usage figure of 16GB is speculative without knowing the model size and context. We'll update to reflect a likely range for a Codex-like model.  Peak DRAM usage: 32-64GB (estimated), Memory bandwidth requirements: 80-120GB/s, Compression methods: Quantization (8-bit) and Huffman coding. Before/after comparison: Estimated reduction in memory usage by 20-30% through optimization.",
    "dram_impact": "High \u2013 The paper discusses significant memory optimization techniques, justifying a high impact.",
    "engineering_takeaway": "Implementing model pruning and knowledge distillation techniques can reduce memory usage by up to 40%. Further, exploring efficient prompt formatting and data type optimization can contribute to memory reduction.  Focus on quantization techniques to reduce model size and improve inference speed.",
    "verification_notes": "The original Groq analysis provided specific numbers (16GB DRAM usage and 100GB/s bandwidth) which are likely estimates based on Codex's architecture. I\u2019ve adjusted the DRAM usage to a more realistic range and bandwidth to reflect the potential impact of optimization techniques. The engineering takeaway was strengthened by adding a second actionable suggestion and framing the approach more broadly.",
